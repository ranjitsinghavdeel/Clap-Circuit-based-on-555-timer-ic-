# Clap_Circuit_based_on_555_timer_ic
The proposed Clap circuit is designed to function as a automatic light switching circuit based on a high decibel clap from user. The system uses LM393 Sound sensor which in coordination with 555 timer ic is connected to make the system. The 555 timer ic is used in monostable state to keep the system running infinitely.
